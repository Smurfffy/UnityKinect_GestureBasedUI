# UnityKinect_GestureBasedUI

This is the reposity for my fourth year project in Gesture Based UI Development in which I have to make software controlled by tracked user gestures. I will be doing so by using Unity and the Kinect sensor to created an infinate runner style game similar to Subway Surfers or Temple Run

To Run this game you need a Kinect V2 and the Kinect SDK. There is a build of this game which you can run which is located in the build folder of the project. you can also clone this project and run it from unity.
